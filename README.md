marcusianlevine.gitpitch
=========

Installs and configures GitPitch on a standalone server. [GitPitch](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch) is a presenation framework that reads Markdown files from hosted Git repositories and prepares dynamic Reveal.js presentations.

This role follows the [offical GitPitch Server Deploy guide](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/wiki/Server-Deploy-Instructions) very closely.

Role Variables
--------------

### Required
* play_secret_key

This is a long ASCII string that is used to sign sessions and cookies. The more worried you are about security, the longer it should be â€” at least 64 characters.

You can generate a key using either a random string generator of your choice, or using the [offical Play framework command line utility](https://playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ApplicationSecret#Generating-an-application-secret).

Since this value is sensitive, you shoud use [Ansible Vault](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html) to encrypt it in your playbooks.

### Optional

* domain
  * If not provided, whichever of hostname or IP is available will be used
* git_key_file
  * If the version of gitpitch you would like to deploy is not hosted in a public repository, you can provide a key file which will be used to authenticate when cloning the repo
* gitpitch_repo_services
  * If you wish to use custom [Git Repo Services](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/wiki/Git-Repo-Services), provide a list of dictionaries of the form found in `defaults/main.yml`

Dependencies
------------

* jpnewman.java
* deiga.sbt
